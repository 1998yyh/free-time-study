On her first morning in the city, as she walked from the hotel to the market, she passed a beggar. On the ground was a piece of paper. It said, \"Blind. Please give generously.\" Alice felt sorry for the beggar, so she put a one-dollar coin into his bowl. She did the same thing on the second day. On the third day, however, Alice did not have a one-dollar coin. She had only fifty cents, so she dropped this into the beggar's bowl. The beggar noticed that she gave him less money than the first two times. So he asked, \"Why did you give less money than before?\" Alice was very surprised by what the beggar said. She asked the beggar how he knew she hadn't given him a dollar. \"Ah,\" explained the beggar, \"to tell you the truth, I'm not blind. I'm just looking after this place for the regular guy while he's on vacation.\" Alice asked in great surprise, \"On vacation? What exactly does your blind friend do on vacation?\" The beggar answered, \"He goes to the countryside and takes photographs. He's a very good photographer.\"\n参考答案2：\nAlice was visiting the capital city, and near her hotel was a beggar. He had a piece of paper which said he was blind and that he hoped others gave him money. Alice felt bad for him, so she left a one-dollar coin for him. On the second day, she gave another one-dollar coin to him. On the third day, Alice only left him fifty cents, since she didn't have a one-dollar coin. The beggar asked her why she'd given him less than the last two times. Alice was surprised, and asked the beggar how he knew she'd given less. Then the beggar admitted he wasn't blind, and that he was just filling in for the regular beggar who was taking a break. Alice asked what the regular beggar did while he was on vacation. The beggar told her he went to take photographs in the countryside. He said he was a very good photographer.",
