    "analysis": "W: Tom, have you been playing any sports recently?<br>\nM: No, Mary. Now I don’t have time for it anymore.<br>\nW: Why not? Are you busy with your job?<br>\nM: Well, I’ve been taking care of my father for the last three months. I moved back home to be with him.<br>\nW: That’s great of you to do that. Is he sick?<br>\nM: Not really. His health is pretty good for someone in their 70s. He does need help with certain things, though. And I think he’s a bit lonely, too.<br>\nW: It must have been hard for him after your mother died.<br>\nM: Yeah, my mother cooked his meals for forty years. My father can barely make coffee! Now I’m trying to teach him some ways to be more independent.<br>\nAnswer: Yeah. He didn’t even know how to boil an egg! But in the past two weeks, he’s made some really nice noodles. And yesterday, he made a great soup.",
