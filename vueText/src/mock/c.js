    "analysis": "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">Practice High Notes</div>\nMrs. Jones was a music teacher. She had a good voice and liked singing very much, except that some of her notes sounded like a gate that had not been oiled. Mrs. Jones knew it, so she wanted to practice these high notes. She often went for a long walk along the country roads and practiced her high notes there. When she heard a car or a person coming along the road, she stopped and waited until she could no longer be heard.<br />\nOne afternoon, she didn’t hear a fast car come up behind her. She was singing some of her highest and most difficult notes at that time. As the car passed, she saw that the driver was very worried. The driver stopped his car suddenly, jumped out, and began to look over all the tires carefully. Mrs. Jones was afraid to tell him what the noise really was. After a while, the driver got back into the car and drove off.\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">参考复述：</div>\nMrs. Jones was a music teacher. She sang well, except for some high notes. When she sang high notes, her voice sounded very bad. So, she often went walking in the countryside to practice singing those high notes. Whenever she saw someone approaching, she’d stop singing until they were far enough away and couldn’t hear her. One day, on a country road, a car quickly came up behind her, but she didn’t hear. As she sang her high notes very loudly, the car passed by, and then suddenly stopped. The driver jumped out of the car and began looking over his tires.
